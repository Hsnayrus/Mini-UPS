Image with Product:
    We have implemented a feature where the customer can look at an image of the package that is being transported.
    In our current implementation we just show a default image for everything. But it can be updated to showing the Product
    link or even the product image from amazon's side provided they have it

New Account Registration:
    Allow users to register with ups using their own username and password credentials and specify their email address for later communication


Timestamps for delivery:
    We thought of giving as much detail as we can to the user and implementing product timestamps was one of the parameters that we thought
    would be useful for users.

Email updates for change in status:
   Customers will be prompted when their orders are waiting to be picked up, loaded, and finally delivered to their final destination
    

Display Username for Logged in Users
    Customers that log in to the UPS website with their credentials will see a personalized version of the site that
    displays their username at the top and allows them to see the set of all packages that are assocated with their
    account


Multithreaded request handling:
    Multithreading allows us to efficiently scale with increased client activity and prevent long user delays


Frontend Super User Admin Page:
    Allow a designated superuser (username="luismor2") to create packages via the UPS front-end. This is a feature that
    was useful in our own testing and would be useful if this were a real web-site for dev deployments.
